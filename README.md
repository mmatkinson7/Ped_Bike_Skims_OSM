# Ped_Bike_Skims_OSM

## Purpose
For their Travel Demand Model, MAPC creates walking and biking skims using data from Open Street Map. The OSM data is used for routing between TAZ centroids to find the shortest path (Djikstra's) using Esri's OD Matrix Network Analyst tool. To avoid using additional costly software and to increase the open source usage in CTPS' Travel Demand Model, this is a test to see the feasability of creating skims from OSM's network using the python library osmnx by Geoff Boeing. 

## Dates
Began October 2021.
